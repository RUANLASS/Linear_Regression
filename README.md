# Linear_Regression

Learning process of building basic linear regression model using California housing prices dataset from Kaggle. All models are built using only Numpy and Pandas. 

Different files:
1. basic.py => simple model using simple 3x4 and 1x3 matrix with given values, using linear regression model, with squared error cost function and gradient descent optimization algorithm.
2. data.py + linear_reg_1.py =>
   - model using an actual dataset, with linear regression model, squared error cost, gradient descent optimization
   - used feature scaling from scratch for optimal convergence of gradient descent
   - carried out data cleaning operations to fix errors
   - prediction accuracy was, however, extremely low.
